Simple little coding challenge, Given a number **N**, such that the digits of N sum up to **k**, create a function such that it returns an integer higher than N, while also satisfying the requirements that the digits of the returned value sum up to k.

#### To run the c++ version

1. the main object file has been compiled to execute, but source code is under ```solution.cpp```
2. To run the binary executable:
   1. In the terminal (linux) type and execute: ```./main <N> <loop_amount>``` where ```<N>``` is our input, and ```<loop_amount>``` is the amount we wish to iterate, such that to check any corresponding values given after the result N.

#### To run the .js version

1. Simply double click on index.html to make it work
2. In order to change the values being checked, under main.js:
   1. Please change the 2 global variables ```init```, which is the value N.
   2. And ```expected```, which is the value k.
